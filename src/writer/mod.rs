//! Output writer abstraction layer for ggsql
//!
//! The writer module provides a pluggable interface for generating visualization
//! outputs from Plot + DataFrame combinations.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! All writers implement the `Writer` trait, which provides:
//! - ResolvedPlot + Data → Output conversion
//! - Validation for writer compatibility
//! - Format-specific rendering logic
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use ggsql::writer::{Writer, VegaLiteWriter};
//! use ggsql::reader::{Reader, DuckDBReader};
//!
//! let reader = DuckDBReader::from_connection_string("duckdb://memory")?;
//! let spec = reader.execute("SELECT 1 as x, 2 as y VISUALISE x, y DRAW point")?;
//!
//! let writer = VegaLiteWriter::new();
//! let json = writer.render(&spec)?;
//! println!("{}", json);
//! ```
//!
//! Writers are configured by their own constructors, or generically from
//! key–value [`WriterOptions`] when a frontend collects settings from a user
//! without knowing which writer they picked.
