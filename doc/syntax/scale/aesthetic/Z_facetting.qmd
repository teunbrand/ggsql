title: Faceting
---

ggsql provides one or two aesthetics related to faceting. These are special in the sense that they do not alter the display of the single data values, but rather alter in which plot they appear. While it is possible to map to these aesthetics in a layer they are most often applied globally as part of the [`FACET` clause](../../clause/facet.qmd).

The aesthetics provided are either `panel` (for 1-dimensional faceting) or `row` and `column` (for 2-dimensional faceting). These aesthetics have to compatible with the facet clause: it is not possible to map to `panel` in a 2-dimensional faceting plot nor is it possible to map `row` and `column` in a 1-dimensional plot.

## Literal values
Scales for facet aesthetics never use an output range and always relate to the input range. This means that no concept of literal values applies.

## Scale types
Since panels are discrete by nature it is not possible to have a continuous scale for a facet. If continuous data is mapped to a facet aesthetic, a binned scale will be applied by default.

```{ggsql}
VISUALISE Date AS x, Temp AS y FROM ggsql:airquality
DRAW line
FACET Date 
    SETTING free => 'x'
SCALE panel
    SETTING breaks => 'month'
SCALE x 
    SETTING breaks => 'weeks'
```

In order to show data where the facet variable is null, it is necessary to explicitly include `null` in the input range of a facet aesthetic scale. Just like discrete positional aesthetics. You can also use `RENAMING` on the scale to customize facet strip labels.

```{ggsql}
VISUALISE sex AS x FROM ggsql:penguins
DRAW bar
FACET species
SCALE panel FROM ['Adelie', null]
    RENAMING null => 'The rest'
```
