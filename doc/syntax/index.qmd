## Main Clauses
ggsql augments the standard SQL syntax with a number of new clauses to describe a visualisation:

- `VISUALISE` initiates the visualisation part of the query
- [`DRAW`](clause/draw.qmd) adds a new layer to the visualisation
- `SCALE` specify how an aesthetic should be scaled
- `FACET` describes how data should be split into small multiples
- `PROJECT` is used for selecting the coordinate system to use

## Layers
There are many different layers to choose from when visualising your data. Some are straightforward translations of your data into visual marks such as a point layer, while others perform more or less complicated calculations like e.g. the histogram layer. A layer is selected by providing the layer name after the `DRAW` clause

- [`point`](layer/point.qmd) is used to create a scatterplot layer
- `line` is used to produce lineplots with the data sorted along the x axis
- `path` is like `line` above but does not sort the data but plot it according to its own order
- `bar` creates a bar chart, optionally calculating y from the number of records in each bar
- `histogram` bins the data along the x axis and produces a bar for each bin showing the number of records in it
