## Main Clauses
ggsql augments the standard SQL syntax with a number of new clauses to describe a visualisation:

- [`VISUALISE`](clause/visualise.qmd) initiates the visualisation part of the query
- [`DRAW`](clause/draw.qmd) adds a new layer to the visualisation
- `SCALE` specify how an aesthetic should be scaled
- `FACET` describes how data should be split into small multiples
- `PROJECT` is used for selecting the coordinate system to use
- `LABEL` is used to manually add titles to the plot or the various axes and legends

## Layers
There are many different layers to choose from when visualising your data. Some are straightforward translations of your data into visual marks such as a point layer, while others perform more or less complicated calculations like e.g. the histogram layer. A layer is selected by providing the layer name after the `DRAW` clause

- [`point`](layer/point.qmd) is used to create a scatterplot layer
- [`line`](layer/line.qmd) is used to produce lineplots with the data sorted along the x axis
- [`path`](layer/path.qmd) is like `line` above but does not sort the data but plot it according to its own order
- [`area`](layer/area.qmd) is used to display series as an area chart.
- [`ribbon`](layer/ribbon.qmd) is used to display series extrema.
- [`polygon`](layer/polygon.qmd) is used to display arbitrary shapes as polygons.
- [`text`](layer/text.qmd) is used to render datapoints as text.
- [`bar`](layer/bar.qmd) creates a bar chart, optionally calculating y from the number of records in each bar
- [`density`](layer/density.qmd) creates univariate kernel density estimates, showing the distribution of a variable
- [`violin`](layer/violin.qmd) displays a rotated kernel density estimate
- [`histogram`](layer/histogram.qmd) bins the data along the x axis and produces a bar for each bin showing the number of records in it
- [`boxplot`](layer/boxplot.qmd) displays continuous variables as 5-number summaries
