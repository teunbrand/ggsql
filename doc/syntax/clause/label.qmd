title: "Define different titles with `LABEL`"
---

The `LABEL` clause is one of the simpler clauses in ggsql an allow you to override the default naming of axes and legends, as well as adding titles to the plot

## Clause syntax
The `LABEL` clause takes one or more labeling settings.

```sql
LABEL <aesthetic/title> => <string>, ...
```

If an `aesthetic` is given, then the title will be used for the relevant axis or legend, e.g. `x => 'my x-axis'` will label the x axis, whereas `fill => 'Species'` will label the legend for fill (if any). 

There are a few additional labels beside the aesthetics that govern the different titles of the plot and can be given instead of an aesthetic name:

* `title`: The main title of the plot
* `subtitle`: An additional, often longer and more descriptive, title beneath the main title
* `caption`: A string placed below the plot, often used to add additional information about the data source etc.

## Automatic labelling logic
Axes and legends get an automatic label from the mapping. The logic is as follows:

1. Start from the global mapping and then go through the layer mappings as they appear.
2. Collect mappings for each aesthetic in the order they appear
3. For each aesthetic determine the label based on the following priority:
  1. An explicitly provided one with `LABEL`
  2. The name of the first appearing column mapping
  3. The name of the aesthetic

This means that constants mapped to an aesthetic doesn't contribute to the derived label, only data columns, and if all else fails the name of the aesthetic will be used.
