title: "Installing ggsql"
---

ggsql is very much still a work in progress and the installation process reflects this. Eventually we will have proper installers but for now please follow this process if you wish to play around with it:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/georgestagg/ggsql
   cd ggsql
   ```

2. **Install tree-sitter CLI:**

   ```bash
   npm install -g tree-sitter-cli
   ```

3. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   cd tree-sitter-ggsql && tree-sitter generate && cd ..
   cargo build
   ```

4. **Install the Jupyter kernel:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --package ggsql-jupyter -- --install
   ```
