## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Side effects like `CREATE TEMP TABLE` before the `VISUALISE` statement are now
  separated from directly feeding into the visualisation data (#415)
- Fixed bug where panel axes were unintentionally anchored to zero when using 
  `FACET ... SETTING free => 'x'/'y'` (#410).
- Fixed bug where faceted data were matched to the incorrect panels (#409)

### Changed

- Restructured how ggsql integrates with ODBC drivers to use the system ODBC,
rather than bundling unixodbc as part of binary releases. This fixes several
issues on Linux and macOS caused by relative paths to dynamic libraries.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Fixed stacking in faceted plots (#403)

## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Add cell delimiters and code lens actions to the Positron extension (#366)
- ODBC is now turned on for the CLI as well (#344)
- `FROM` can now come before `VISUALIZE`, mirroring the DuckDB style. This means
that `FROM table VISUALIZE x, y` and `VISUALIZE x, y FROM table` are equivalent
queries (#369)
- CLI now has built-in documentation through the `docs` command as well as a
skill for llms through the `skill` command (#361)
- The ggsql wasm package is now published on GitHub Releases and NPM (#367)

### Fixed

- Rendering of inline plots in Positron had a bad interaction with how we
handled auto-resizing in the plot pane. We now have a per-output-location path
in the Jupyter kernel (#360)
- Passing the shape aesthetic via `SETTING` now correctly translates named
shapes (#368)
- Asterisk shape now has lines 60 degrees apart, giving an even shape
- `validate()` now reports an actionable error when a SQL expression (e.g.
`CAST(...)` or a function call) appears inside a `VISUALISE` mapping, instead
of silently treating the entire query as SQL (#389)
- Error messages no longer leak internal aesthetic names. Validation, scale,
and writer errors now report user-facing aesthetic names (`x`, `y`, `panel`,
`row`, …) instead of internal forms (`pos1`, `pos2`, `facet1`, …), translated
based on the active coordinate system and facet layout (#388).
- Fixed opacity calculation in point layers with Vega-Lite (#393)
- Fixed an issue with case-sensitive column references in mappings (#374)
- Fixed SQL function set quantifiers in the ggsql grammar (#395)
- Fixed loading of dynamic libraries in PyPI build of `ggsql-jupyter` (#355, #392)
- Fixed an issue with OOB null-filtering, leading to missing median lines in boxplots (#394)

### Changed

- Reverted an earlier decision to materialize CTEs and the global query in Rust
before registering them back to the backend. We now keep the data purely on the
backend until the layer query as was always intended (#363)
- Relieved some grammatical constraints on the SQL-portion before the VISUALISE
portion (#364).
- Simplified internal approach to DataFrame with DuckDB reader (#365)
- Moved the CLI to its own module rather than be part of the main crate (#379)
- Restructured CLAUDE.md to better deal with the rising complexity of the project (#382)
- Renamed the `errorbar` layer to `range`. The geom was never error-specific and is generally useful for displaying intervals (min/max ranges, candlestick wicks, percentile bands, etc.).
- The `segment` layer now requires both `xend` and `yend` (rather than auto-filling a missing endpoint from the start position). For axis-aligned 1D intervals — lollipops, candlestick wicks, etc. — use the `range` layer instead.

### Removed

- Removed polars from dependency list along with all its transient dependencies. Rewrote DataFrame struct on top of arrow (#350)
- Moved ggsql-python to its own repo (posit-dev/ggsql-python) and cleaned up any additional references to it
- Moved ggsql-r to its own repo (posit-dev/ggsql-r)

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-20

- First alpha release. No changes tracked before this
