## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

ggSQL supports two patterns for working with CTEs:

1. **Traditional Pattern**: `WITH ... SELECT ... VISUALISE AS`
2. **Shorthand Pattern**: `WITH ... VISUALISE FROM <cte> AS` (injected SELECT)

### Simple CTE with VISUALISE FROM

The shorthand syntax automatically injects `SELECT * FROM <cte>`:

```sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) as month,
        SUM(revenue) as total_revenue
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date)
)
VISUALISE FROM monthly_sales AS PLOT
DRAW line
    MAPPING month AS x, total_revenue AS y
SCALE x SETTING type TO 'date'
LABEL title = 'Monthly Revenue Trends',
      x = 'Month',
      y = 'Revenue ($)'
```

### Traditional CTE with SELECT

Use the traditional pattern when you need to filter or transform CTE results:

```sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) as month,
        region,
        SUM(revenue) as total_revenue
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date), region
)
SELECT * FROM monthly_sales WHERE region = 'North'
VISUALISE AS PLOT
DRAW line
    MAPPING month AS x, total_revenue AS y
SCALE x SETTING type TO 'date'
```

### Multiple CTEs

Chain multiple CTEs and visualize from any of them:

```sql
WITH daily_sales AS (
    SELECT sale_date, region, SUM(revenue) as revenue
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY sale_date, region
),
regional_totals AS (
    SELECT region, SUM(revenue) as total
    FROM daily_sales
    GROUP BY region
)
VISUALISE FROM regional_totals AS PLOT
DRAW bar
    MAPPING region AS x, total AS y, region AS fill
COORD flip
LABEL title = 'Total Revenue by Region',
      x = 'Region',
      y = 'Total Revenue ($)'
```

### CTE with JOIN

CTEs can contain complex queries including JOINs:

```sql
WITH product_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        p.product_name,
        p.category,
        SUM(s.quantity) as total_sold,
        SUM(s.revenue) as total_revenue
    FROM products p
    JOIN sales s ON p.product_id = s.product_id
    WHERE s.sale_date >= '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY p.product_name, p.category
)
VISUALISE FROM product_metrics AS PLOT
DRAW point
    MAPPING total_sold AS x, total_revenue AS y, category AS color
LABEL title = 'Product Performance',
      x = 'Units Sold',
      y = 'Revenue ($)'
```

### Recursive CTE

Recursive CTEs work with VISUALISE FROM:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE series AS (
    SELECT 1 as n, 1 as value
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1, value * 2
    FROM series
    WHERE n < 10
)
VISUALISE FROM series AS PLOT
DRAW line
    MAPPING n AS x, value AS y
DRAW point
    MAPPING n AS x, value AS y
SCALE y SETTING type TO 'log10'
LABEL title = 'Exponential Growth',
      x = 'Step',
      y = 'Value (log scale)'
```

### CTE with Window Functions

Calculate running totals or rankings in CTEs:

```sql
WITH ranked_products AS (
    SELECT
        product_name,
        category,
        revenue,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY revenue DESC) as rank
    FROM product_sales
)
SELECT * FROM ranked_products WHERE rank <= 5
VISUALISE AS PLOT
DRAW bar
    MAPPING product_name AS x, revenue AS y, category AS color
FACET WRAP category SETTING scales TO 'free_x'
COORD flip
LABEL title = 'Top 5 Products per Category',
      x = 'Product',
      y = 'Revenue ($)'
```

### Temporal Analysis with CTEs

Create time-based aggregations:

```sql
WITH daily_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp) as day,
        AVG(temperature) as avg_temp,
        MAX(temperature) as max_temp,
        MIN(temperature) as min_temp
    FROM sensor_data
    WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp)
)
VISUALISE FROM daily_metrics AS PLOT
DRAW ribbon
    MAPPING day AS x, min_temp AS ymin, max_temp AS ymax, 'lightblue' AS fill
    SETTING alpha TO 0.3
DRAW line
    MAPPING day AS x, avg_temp AS y, 'blue' AS color
    SETTING size TO 2
SCALE x SETTING type TO 'date'
LABEL title = 'Temperature Range (Last 30 Days)',
      x = 'Date',
      y = 'Temperature (°C)'
```

### Important Rules

**✅ Valid Combinations:**
- `WITH cte AS (...) VISUALISE FROM cte AS PLOT` - Shorthand (SELECT injected)
- `WITH cte AS (...) SELECT * FROM cte VISUALISE AS PLOT` - Traditional
- `CREATE TABLE x ...; WITH cte AS (...) VISUALISE FROM cte AS PLOT` - Multiple statements

**❌ Invalid Combinations:**
- `WITH cte AS (...) SELECT * FROM cte VISUALISE FROM cte AS PLOT` - Cannot mix SELECT with VISUALISE FROM
- `SELECT * FROM x VISUALISE FROM y AS PLOT` - Cannot use VISUALISE FROM after SELECT

**Why VISUALISE FROM?**

The shorthand syntax (`VISUALISE FROM`) is useful when:
1. You want to visualize an entire CTE without filtering
2. You're working with tables or views directly
3. You want concise syntax for simple visualizations

Use the traditional pattern (`SELECT ... VISUALISE AS`) when:
1. You need to filter or transform CTE results
2. You're using set operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)
3. You need complex SELECT logic before visualization

      y = 'Y Axis'
```

```sql
SELECT
    cyl,
    COUNT(*) as vehicle_count
FROM data_points
WHERE cyl IN (4, 6, 8)
GROUP BY cyl
ORDER BY cyl
VISUALISE AS PLOT
DRAW bar
    MAPPING cyl AS x, vehicle_count AS y
SCALE x SETTING domain TO [4, 6, 8]
LABEL title = 'Distribution of Vehicles by Number of Cylinders',
      x = 'Number of Cylinders',
      y = 'Number of Vehicles'
```

## Case Insensitivity

ggSQL keywords are case-insensitive. All of the following are valid:

```sql
-- Uppercase (traditional)
VISUALISE AS PLOT
DRAW line
    MAPPING date AS x, value AS y

-- Lowercase
visualise as plot
draw line
    mapping date as x, value as y

-- Mixed case
Visualise As Plot
Draw Line
    Mapping date AS x, value AS y
```

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Date Handling**: Always use `SCALE x SETTING type TO 'date'` for date columns to ensure proper axis formatting.

2. **Color Mappings**: Use `color` for continuous data and `fill` for categorical data in bars/areas.

3. **Coordinate Limits**: Set explicit limits with `COORD cartesian SETTING xlim TO [min, max]` to control axis ranges.

4. **Faceting**: Use faceting to create small multiples when comparing across categories.

5. **Multiple Layers**: Combine layers (e.g., line + point) for richer visualizations.

6. **Themes**: Apply themes last in your specification for consistent styling.

7. **Labels**: Always provide meaningful titles and axis labels for clarity.

8. **Domain Specification**: Use either SCALE or COORD for domain/limit specification, but not both for the same aesthetic.
